<b> Kar-Wai Wong's trademarks: <b>
<ul>
<li> Abstract, abrupt and ambiguous endings with the characters left with ambivalent feelings at the end, leaving the outcome "post-ending" to the viewer's choice and interpretation </li>
<li> Uses a lot of symbolism or visually metaphorical situations to depict the moods of his characters in various situations while they are doing apparently mundane things on-screen </li>
<li> Multiple narrators are frequently shown in his films with mostly the thoughts of the respective character being expressed via his/her narration </li>
<li>Quick freeze-frames to emphasize the specific important moments in the middle of some scenes </li>
<li> Frequent usage of time-lapse photography </li>
<li> Opening and closing credits against a red or blue backdrop </li>
<li>Usage of flip clocks to show the time in particular scenes </li>
  <li> Dull-lit &/or color-filtered-lit rooms </li>
<li> In his films, characters are shown having a conversation mostly off-screen or with their faces reflected in mirrors (often out of focus) or other reflective surfaces, with only their voices being heard by the viewer </li>
<li>His films are either period pieces set in the 1960s or his modern era films feature songs from the '60s in background </li>
<li> Often casts Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung in his films </li>
